# Agent authoring baseline

This offline task suite measures concrete authoring outcomes through the existing
headless/tooling surface. It complements unit tests; it is not a model benchmark,
GPU screenshot test, or a claim about time saved by an agent.

## Reproduce

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm exec vitest run test/cli/agent-authoring-journeys.test.ts test/app/devtools-camera-framing.test.ts test/cli/camera-framing-tools.test.ts
```

The suite uses seed 42 for authoring journeys and a local committed GLB
(`examples/developer-api/public/assets/cube.glb`). It runs strict asset loading
with HTTP disabled and verifies that no asset placeholders were substituted.
Tests create fresh worlds and require no browser, embedding model, or account.
The repository's shuffled test order remains enabled.

## Journey contracts

| Journey                   | Required outcome                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| First scene               | Boot, settle, find a keyed mesh, read its transform, extract a mesh draw                         |
| GLB import and edit       | Inspect real imported mesh data, resolve the imported root, edit scale and verify the result     |
| Compose and revise        | Capture an ECS checkpoint, edit a transform, read it back and report exactly one changed entity  |
| Diagnose an edit          | Reject an unsupported field with an actionable diagnostic and preserve the authored transform    |
| Interaction and replay    | Inject a semantic button, move the subject through an authored system, reset the seed and replay |
| Frame unfamiliar geometry | Fit unknown dimensions and hierarchies, then verify bounds with actual extracted camera matrices |

The first five journeys already passed on the baseline implementation. They
protect existing strengths rather than implying those workflows were missing.

## Framing experiment

`camera_fit_entity` preserves its existing point-plus-radius contract. Without
an explicit radius, all six controlled shape cases place the camera five units
from the subject origin. The distance alone is sufficient for only two of the
six complete AABBs, even assuming an ideal orientation:

| Case                     | Dimensions         | Aspect | Fixed distance 5 contains bounds |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Unit cube                | 1 × 1 × 1          | 1      | Yes                              |
| Large cube               | 20 × 20 × 20       | 1      | No                               |
| Tall product             | 2 × 20 × 2         | 1.5    | No                               |
| Wide product in portrait | 20 × 2 × 2         | 0.5    | No                               |
| Tiny prop                | 0.01 × 0.01 × 0.01 | 1      | Yes                              |
| Deep assembly            | 2 × 2 × 20         | 1      | No                               |

This baseline intentionally isolates radius adequacy from legacy camera
orientation behavior. It is not a six-task agent success rate, nor a diagnosis
that a caller-supplied radius is incorrect.

The new `camera_frame_entities` succeeds on all six cases without caller-side
bounds calculations or radius guesses. The test projects all eight aggregate
bounds corners with the actual extracted Float32 view-projection matrix,
checking positive clip W, X/Y margin and WebGPU depth in [0, 1]. Additional
acceptance coverage includes:

- A real GLB root with nested meshes, rotated/nonuniform/negative scales
- Perspective and orthographic cameras, narrow portrait viewports and near-pole angles
- Overlapping and disjoint selections, exclusion of descendants, and repeat calls
- An initially offscreen subject with no extracted mesh draws
- Immediate extraction after framing, with no simulation step to refresh the camera
- Headless and generated-worker routing, including cameras created after viewport resize
- A deterministic 48-case size/aspect/angle grid for each projection
- Invalid selectors, ancestor hierarchies, empty/unavailable/invalid source bounds,
  and Float32 precision errors that preserve authored camera state

## Scope of evidence

The fit is based on static mesh-source AABBs. Selected hidden or differently
layered meshes still contribute; animated skin/morph/shader displacement is not
measured. Projection containment does not establish material correctness,
lighting, occlusion, scissor visibility, or rendered pixels. Final visual
acceptance still requires `render_diagnose`/`frame_capture` and a working WebGPU
browser.

See [AI tooling](AI_TOOLING.md#frame-an-imported-model-or-composed-scene) for the
public call contract and result fields.

## Editing-affordance experiment

`test/cli/entity-editing-affordances.test.ts` covers the inspection/edit/read-back
journey using published MCP argument shapes and runtime mutation metadata.
Previously the seven entity query/selection/schema/mutation/checkpoint tools
advertised only routing keys (`target`, `appRoot`). The component schema exposed
storage types but no machine-readable editing permissions.

The expanded contracts now describe selectors, nested queries, imported-source
filters, snapshot labels/references and complete mutation values. A camera
schema identifies its 10 allowlisted fields and 9 read-only fields directly from the
existing registry. Original type values, enum maps and defaults are unchanged.

Acceptance covers valid edits, readonly-field and nested-path rejections,
unchanged numeric/quaternion checks, runtime-spawned custom schema visibility,
source matching, selector-history fallback, and JSON-RPC serialization. Mutating
a returned metadata list does not grant any additional writing capability.
These are deterministic contract checks, not measured agent success rates or
claims of superiority over another library.

## Transform-group composition

`test/app/spawn-group.test.ts` compares `spawn.group` against the prior explicit
entity/metadata/transform-component construction recipe. The helper produces the
same ordinary ECS state while avoiding that low-level boilerplate. It allocates
no mesh, material or other rendering asset.

Acceptance checks nested local transforms, world-preserving reparenting through
the existing hierarchy API, sibling isolation after revision, recursive teardown,
failed-construction cleanup, and a real GLB plus procedural base surviving a
session snapshot/restore. The restored assembly is framed and extracted through
the existing tools. This is structural evidence; no new visual-parity claim is
made from it.

## Native procedural authoring loop

The cross-feature acceptance test runs the built Node CLI as a separate process,
so Vitest's source aliases cannot substitute for shipped package imports:

```sh
pnpm run build
pnpm exec vitest run test/cli/procedural-authoring-native.test.ts
```

It writes a temporary app configuration and TypeScript system, then talks to
`aperture mcp stdio` using JSON-RPC. The system authors a transform-only group,
a low-poly torus, a box, lights and a camera. Each independently parameterized
mesh has its own key, preserving the facade's existing asset-identity contract.

The test discovers tool schemas and writable transform fields, edits the group,
checks unchanged child-local transforms and updated world transforms, and compares
matching ECS checkpoint selectors. It frames the complete assembly, saves a session,
resets and restores it, then verifies authored state with remapped parent references.
Finally it exports a real-asset render bundle and checks both mesh draws, all four
mesh/material entries, and complete dependency closure without placeholders.

Build before running the test; it intentionally does not rebuild while parallel
test workers may be reading `dist`. Temporary app files and the exact child process
are cleaned up after the test. This closes the native module-loading and MCP
integration loop, but does not execute a WebGPU renderer or validate pixels.
