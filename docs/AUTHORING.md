# Authoring Aperture Apps

The default Aperture app is a Vite app with an `aperture.config.ts` file and
worker-discovered ECS systems. The Vite plugin owns browser bootstrap, worker
bundling, asset preload, render extraction, snapshot transport, WebGPU
submission, resize, input forwarding, command forwarding, and diagnostics.

You should be able to see a primitive mesh or GLB without calling
`createWebGpuApp()`, `createExtractionApp()`, `stepAndExtract()`, posting render
snapshots, registering renderer-side assets, or writing a main-thread scene
graph.

## First App Shape

Normal browser apps use this shape:

- `vite.config.ts`: installs the Aperture Vite plugin.
- `aperture.config.ts`: declares mode, canvas, systems, assets, render defaults,
  input actions, signals, and diagnostics.
- `src/systems/*.system.ts`: default-export ECS system classes that run in the
  simulation worker.
- `index.html`: contains the configured canvas.

`index.ts` is not required for the first scene.

```html
<canvas id="aperture"></canvas>
```

## CLI Templates

`@aperture-engine/cli` can scaffold app roots without a separate create package:

```sh
npx @aperture-engine/cli create my-app
npx @aperture-engine/cli create viewer --template glb-viewer
npx @aperture-engine/cli create game --template game
```

Available templates:

- `minimal`: primitive cube, setup/spin systems, input action, signal, AI
  adapter files, and render quality defaults.
- `glb-viewer`: local `public/assets/sample-cube.glb`, blocking GLB asset
  manifest entry, setup system, orbit system, stable `viewer.sampleCube` key,
  and deterministic priorities.
- `game`: local GLB collectible asset, player movement input actions, score and
  goal signals, camera follow, collectible/goal state, and deterministic
  priorities.

Generated apps include `.mcp.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, Claude/Cursor/Copilot
adapter files, and scripts for `dev`, `build`, and `typecheck`.

## Vite Config

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { aperture } from "@aperture-engine/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [aperture()],
});
```

`@aperture-engine/vite-plugin` is the canonical plugin import. The root
`@aperture-engine/app` entry does not export the plugin because Vite plugin code
is Node/build-time code. `@aperture-engine/app/vite` re-exports the same plugin
as an optional convenience subpath, but this guide uses the canonical package.

## Aperture Config

```ts
import {
  asset,
  defineApertureConfig,
  input,
  signal,
} from "@aperture-engine/app/config";

export default defineApertureConfig({
  mode: "browser",
  canvas: "#aperture",
  systems: ["src/systems/**/*.system.ts"],
  assets: {
    robot: asset.gltf("/assets/robot.glb", { preload: "blocking" }),
    floorColor: asset.texture("/assets/floor.png", { preload: "background" }),
    decal: asset.texture("/assets/decal.png", { preload: "manual" }),
  },
  signals: {
    selectedEntity: signal.ref(null),
    gameplayMode: signal.string("edit"),
  },
  input: {
    actions: {
      select: input.button([input.pointer("primary")]),
      jump: input.button([input.key("Space"), input.gamepadButton("south")]),
      move: input.axis2d([
        input.keyboard2d({
          negativeX: ["ArrowLeft", "KeyA"],
          positiveX: ["ArrowRight", "KeyD"],
        }),
        input.gamepadStick("left"),
      ]),
    },
  },
  render: {
    clearColor: [0.03, 0.035, 0.04, 1],
    defaultCamera: true,
    defaultLight: true,
    sampleCount: 4,
    maxPixelRatio: 2,
  },
  diagnostics: {
    level: "warn",
  },
});
```

Asset preload policies:

- `blocking`: loaded before the first simulation tick.
- `background`: starts immediately and exposes readiness signals to systems.
- `manual`: registered in the manifest and loaded when a system or command
  requests it.

Headless apps use the same config shape with `mode: "headless"` and no canvas.
The same system files can run in browser and headless mode.

Generated browser apps default to 4x MSAA when `render.sampleCount` is omitted.
Use `sampleCount: 1` to opt out for performance-sensitive apps. Canvas backing
size follows device pixel ratio capped by `render.maxPixelRatio`, which defaults
to `2`; use `render.pixelRatio` when an app needs an exact fixed backing-scale
policy. Generated diagnostics report the CSS size, backing size, effective pixel
ratio, aspect ratio, and MSAA state.

## Setup System

Scene setup is ECS startup work in a worker system, not mutation of a
main-thread app object.

```ts
import { createSystem, material, mesh } from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

export default class SetupSystem extends createSystem({
  priority: 0,
}) {
  override init(): void {
    this.spawn.camera({
      key: "camera.main",
      name: "main-camera",
      transform: {
        translation: [0, 1.5, 5],
        lookAt: [0, 0.75, 0],
      },
      fovYDegrees: 60,
    });

    this.spawn.light({
      key: "light.key",
      name: "key-light",
      kind: "directional",
      intensity: 4,
      transform: {
        rotationEulerDegrees: [-45, 35, 0],
      },
    });

    this.spawn.mesh({
      key: "level.crate.primary",
      name: "crate",
      tags: ["interactive", "crate"],
      mesh: mesh.box({ size: [1, 1, 1] }),
      material: material.standard({
        baseColor: [1, 0.55, 0.25, 1],
        roughness: 0.55,
        metallic: 0.05,
      }),
      transform: { translation: [-1, 0.5, 0] },
    });

    this.spawn.gltf(this.assets.gltf("robot"), {
      key: "level.robot",
      name: "robot",
      tags: ["asset", "robot"],
      transform: { translation: [1, 0, 0] },
    });
  }
}
```

`name` is a debugging label. `key` is optional app-authored identity when a
globally unique stable lookup is useful. `tags` are optional discovery metadata
for tools and diagnostics. The canonical runtime identity remains
`{ index, generation }`.

## Primitive And GLB Spawning

Use `this.spawn.mesh(...)` for built-in primitives and
`this.spawn.gltf(...)` for config-declared GLB assets:

```ts
this.spawn.mesh({
  key: "level.floor",
  name: "floor",
  mesh: mesh.plane({ size: [6, 6] }),
  material: material.standard({ baseColor: [0.85, 0.88, 0.9, 1] }),
  transform: {
    rotationEulerDegrees: [-90, 0, 0],
  },
});

this.spawn.gltf(this.assets.gltf("robot"), {
  key: "level.robot",
  transform: { translation: [1, 0, 0] },
});
```

The high-level GLB path hides loader reports, source asset transfer packages,
renderer-side registration, primitive material resolution, ECS command planning,
and ECS replay. Systems consume typed config handles and the generated runtime
mirrors render assets to WebGPU.

### Subdivided planes

`mesh.plane({ size: [width, height], subdivisions: 8 })` creates an XY-plane
grid with eight cells along each axis. It has 81 shared vertices and 128
triangles, positive-Z normals and UVs spanning 0–1. Rotate the plane through
its entity transform to use it as a ground surface. Subdivision adds vertices;
it does not displace them or create terrain height automatically.

`subdivisions` defaults to 1. Finite values are floored and clamped to 1–128;
non-finite values use 1. The default preserves the original four-vertex plane.
For unequal grid dimensions, the lower-level `createPlaneMeshAsset` factory
accepts separate `widthSegments` and `heightSegments` options.

### Ring-shaped procedural parts

Use `mesh.torus` for a ring, tire, or handle without lower-level mesh-registry
plumbing. It routes directly to the existing `createTorusMeshAsset` factory:

```ts
this.spawn.mesh({
  key: "vehicle.frontWheel.ring",
  mesh: mesh.torus({
    label: "Low-poly wheel ring",
    majorRadius: 0.8,
    tubeRadius: 0.2,
    radialSegments: 12,
    tubeSegments: 6,
  }),
  material: material.standard({
    baseColor: [0.12, 0.13, 0.15, 1],
    roughness: 0.9,
  }),
  transform: {
    translation: [0, 1, 0],
    rotationEulerDegrees: [90, 0, 0],
  },
  castShadow: true,
  receiveShadow: true,
});
```

The default ring lies in the XZ plane around the Y axis; the example rotates it
upright. `majorRadius` measures from the center to the tube center, while
`tubeRadius` is the tube's cross-section radius. Choose `majorRadius > tubeRadius`
for an open center. `radialSegments` goes around the ring and `tubeSegments`
around its cross-section. Lower counts give controllable low-poly silhouettes.

Defaults match the underlying factory: `majorRadius: 0.75`, `tubeRadius: 0.25`,
`radialSegments: 32`, `tubeSegments: 12`, and label `"Torus"`. Nonpositive or
non-finite radii fall back to those defaults. Finite segment counts are floored
and clamped to 3–128; non-finite counts use 3. This is the existing factory's
normalization, not a new validation or geometry implementation.

Use unique entity keys for independently parameterized primitives. The app
facade retains key/name-based mesh-handle identity for explicitly keyed or
named spawns. If both are omitted, each spawned entity gets independent mesh
and material assets, so later anonymous primitives cannot change its geometry
or appearance. Anonymous asset IDs are deterministic for the same entity-creation
sequence and initial registry state;
use explicit handles when sharing assets is intentional. This does not introduce
content-addressed deduplication. Assets are registry-owned and remain available
after an entity is destroyed; for repeated spawn/despawn of identical parts,
reuse explicit mesh and material handles rather than allocating new descriptors.

`spawn.mesh` converts both descriptors and validates its ordinary metadata,
transform, and physics inputs before publishing descriptor assets. If those
steps throw, the partial entity is destroyed, existing registry entries stay
unchanged, and you can correct the input and retry the same key. Duplicate-key
failures also discard the new entity and leave the original entity intact.
Successful named/keyed spawns retain their existing asset-replacement behavior;
explicit handles are reused without republishing. Assets are ready when a
synchronous query requiring `Mesh` and `Material` observes the new entity.
This is input-failure recovery, not a general transaction: throwing user
accessors, query observers, or overridden registry methods can have side effects
that are not rolled back. Failed attempts may advance ECS entity generations.

`TorusMeshDescriptorOptions` is exported from
`@aperture-engine/app/systems`, and supports exactly the factory's options.
Tori can be children of `spawn.group`, included in snapshots and render bundles,
and inspected with the same mesh-bounds framing tools.

### Custom triangles for roofs, ramps, and irregular props

Use `mesh.triangleList` when primitives cannot express a part's silhouette.
Author local-space position tuples and optional indices; each consecutive triple
is one triangle. Counterclockwise winding is front-facing. For example, this
closed triangular roof uses six positions and eight outward-facing triangles:

```ts
import { mesh, material } from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

this.spawn.mesh({
  key: "house.roof",
  mesh: mesh.triangleList({
    label: "Low-poly roof",
    positions: [
      [-1, 0, 1],
      [1, 0, 1],
      [0, 1, 1],
      [-1, 0, -1],
      [1, 0, -1],
      [0, 1, -1],
    ],
    indices: [
      0,
      1,
      2,
      3,
      5,
      4, // gables
      0,
      3,
      4,
      0,
      4,
      1, // underside
      0,
      2,
      5,
      0,
      5,
      3, // left slope
      1,
      4,
      5,
      1,
      5,
      2, // right slope
    ],
  }),
  material: material.standard({ baseColor: [0.6, 0.16, 0.07, 1] }),
  transform: { translation: [0, 2, 0] },
  castShadow: true,
  receiveShadow: true,
});
```

Keep the generated app's daylight environment, a shadow-casting sun and ground
receiver; see [Visual Quality](./VISUAL_QUALITY.md) for the lighting recipe.
This is ordinary ECS mesh authoring and uses the existing triangle-list render,
spatial-query, asset-mirror and snapshot paths.

The options are intentionally small:

- `positions`: required array of `[x, y, z]` tuples, at least three vertices
- `indices`: optional number array, `Uint16Array` or `Uint32Array`; zero-based
  integers referencing source positions. Without indices, positions are consumed
  in triples. The triangle corner count must be a positive multiple of three
- `normals`: optional `[nx, ny, nz]` tuples, exactly one per source position.
  Nonzero explicit normals are normalized and preserve the authored vertex/index
  layout. Omit normals for flat shading: the factory expands each face's three
  corners and computes its own normal, so shared positions keep crisp edges
- `uvs`: optional `[u, v]` tuples, exactly one per source position, remapped when
  flat faces expand. Missing UVs are `[0, 0]`; this helper does not unwrap a mesh
- `label`: optional string, default `"TriangleList"`

To share indexed vertices with authored smooth normals, a ramp surface can use
`positions: [[0,0,0], [2,1,0], [2,1,-1], [0,0,-1]]`,
`indices: [0,1,2, 0,2,3]` and four `[-1,2,0]` normals. Explicit normals are
not generated, welded or crease-angle averaged. Winding is unchanged even if
supplied normals face another direction. For two-sided surfaces, author both
sides or choose an appropriate material render state.

Every coordinate, normal and UV must be finite after conversion to float32.
Faces with zero-area after this conversion (including repeated indices or
positions that round together) are rejected with their triangle number and
source range. Normals must remain nonzero, all attribute counts must match, and
bounds must fit finite float32 storage. Invalid app inputs throw
`aperture.spawn.invalidTriangleListMesh` with `detail.path` and a suggested fix;
validation completes before mesh asset publication. Correct the input and retry
the same entity key; the failed attempt does not retain a partial mesh entity.

The resulting asset owns its buffers and bounds; later input mutation cannot
change it. Like other descriptors, `mesh.triangleList` shallow-copies its options
and reads nested arrays when spawned. Flat output is non-indexed. Explicit-normal
indexed output uses `uint16` up to maximum referenced index 65535 and `uint32`
above that, regardless of the input array type. Bounds use stored float32
positions; unused source positions are discarded during flat expansion, but
retained and included in bounds when explicit normals preserve the source layout.
There is one submesh and one material slot; use separate keyed entities for
multi-material parts or the lower-level `MeshAsset` schema for custom layouts.

`TriangleListMeshDescriptorOptions` is exported from
`@aperture-engine/app/systems`. Lower-level consumers can import
`createTriangleListMeshAsset`, `TriangleListMeshOptions`, `TriangleListPosition`,
`TriangleListNormal`, `TriangleListUv`, and `TriangleListMeshError` from
`@aperture-engine/render`; the factory throws the latter (a `RangeError` with a
`path` property). No change to existing primitive normalization is implied.

Repository verification, after `pnpm run build` with a Node version supporting
native TypeScript, can reproduce the roof/ramp scene and a real local GLB import:

```sh
node test/fixtures/triangle-authoring/verify.mjs /tmp/triangle-authoring.json
pnpm exec vitest run test/mesh/triangle-list.test.ts \
  test/app/triangle-list-spawn.test.ts test/cli/triangle-authoring-native.test.ts
```

The first command writes a closure-checked render bundle at the supplied path.
These checks establish source geometry, extraction, bounds, byte round-trips and
package-consumer behavior. They do not verify GPU pixels or measure agent success
against another engine.

### Compose reusable procedural groups

`this.spawn.group(...)` creates a transform-only ECS entity for an assembly.
It accepts the same `name`, unique `key`, `tags` and `transform` metadata as
other spawn helpers, and returns an ordinary `Entity`. It adds no mesh,
material, light, camera, or render asset.

Inside a system's `init`, parent authored parts to that entity:

```ts
const bench = this.spawn.group({
  key: "bench.west",
  name: "West bench",
  tags: ["assembly", "editable"],
  transform: {
    translation: [-2, 0, 0],
    rotationEulerDegrees: [0, 15, 0],
  },
});

this.spawn.mesh({
  key: "bench.west.seat",
  mesh: mesh.box({ size: [2, 0.2, 0.6] }),
  material: material.standard({ baseColor: [0.35, 0.16, 0.07, 1] }),
  transform: { parent: bench, translation: [0, 0.9, 0] },
  castShadow: true,
  receiveShadow: true,
});

for (const [index, x] of [-0.75, 0.75].entries()) {
  this.spawn.mesh({
    key: `bench.west.leg.${index}`,
    mesh: mesh.box({ size: [0.18, 0.8, 0.5] }),
    material: material.standard({ baseColor: [0.12, 0.13, 0.15, 1] }),
    transform: { parent: bench, translation: [x, 0.4, 0] },
    castShadow: true,
  });
}
```

Keep the normal scene lighting/default environment from the templates. This
snippet defines an assembly, not a replacement lighting or rendering setup.
Use a key prefix when building several instances so each entity key stays
unique. Groups can parent other groups, procedural parts, or imported GLB
roots using `transform: { parent: group, ... }`.

Transforms supplied at spawn are local to `transform.parent`; without a parent,
they are root transforms. The usual simulation transform-resolution phase
computes world matrices. Moving/scaling/rotating a group's `LocalTransform`
therefore changes the whole subtree while preserving each part's local values.
For an already-authored entity, `this.hierarchy.setParent(childRef, parentRef)`
is the separate world-preserving reparenting operation and reports unsupported
transform cases.

The authoritative relationship is the ECS `Parent` component. There is no
renderer-owned group object or parallel scene graph. Names/tags, materials,
visibility and other component values are not implicitly inherited by children.
Inspect the full tree through `ecs_get_hierarchy`; use
`this.hierarchy.despawnRecursive({ index: bench.index, generation: bench.generation })`
to remove an assembly and its descendants. A bare `Entity.destroy()` is not the
recursive teardown operation.

Groups participate in ordinary ECS snapshots/restores. Agent tools can find a
group by key, revise its allowlisted local transform, and frame its descendant
mesh bounds with `camera_frame_entities`. Unknown top-level options produce the
existing spawn warning; put `parent` inside `transform`. Failed group
construction does not leave a partial entity behind.

### Imported-model lighting and appearance

Use `spawn.lightRig` for deterministic ECS-owned presentation lighting:

```ts
this.spawn.lightRig({
  key: "lighting.presentation",
  preset: "studio-neutral",
  environmentMap: this.assets.hdr("studioEnvironment"),
  shadows: true,
});
```

The public presets are `studio-neutral`, `outdoor-neutral`, and `none`; their
inspectable definitions are exported as `LIGHT_RIG_PRESETS`. The returned rig
lists its root and light entities and has `remove()` to destroy everything it
owns. Override `environment`, `keyLight`, or `rimLight` without introducing
renderer-only state. `spawn.environment({ source, intensity })` is the direct
single-entity form.

Imported glTF materials use the source policy unless `materials` is provided.
The option accepts `StandardMaterialPatch` or
`material.preset("source" | "painted-stylized" | "matte" | "preview-safe",
overrides?)`. Patches apply to cloned/reused materials for the spawned subtree;
source assets are never mutated. See
[Spawn a glTF scene](recipes/spawn-gltf-scene.md) for the complete field list
and [Lighting imported models](recipes/lighting-imported-models.md) for the
physically faithful and stylized paths.

Light `intensity` is currently a unitless renderer scalar. `illuminance`
continues to work for compatibility but is deprecated because Aperture does
not perform lux conversion. When both are supplied, `intensity` wins and the
authoring diagnostics report the conflict.

Current primitive descriptors include:

- `mesh.box({ size })`
- `mesh.sphere({ radius, segments? })`
- `mesh.capsule({ radius, depth, segments? })`
- `mesh.plane({ size, subdivisions? })`
- `mesh.cylinder({ radius, depth, segments? })`
- `mesh.cone({ radius, depth, segments? })`

## Prefabs

Prefabs are serialized `ApertureSceneDocument` blueprints. Author the source
subtree in an ECS world, serialize it with `saveScene(world)`, register the
document through `this.prefabs.register(document)`, then instantiate it with
`this.spawn.prefab(handle, options)`.

```ts
import { saveScene } from "@aperture-engine/simulation";

const document = saveScene(templateWorld);
const cratePrefab = this.prefabs.register(document, { id: "crate.prefab" });

this.spawn.prefab(cratePrefab, {
  key: "crate.instance.1",
  transform: { translation: [0, 0, 0] },
});
```

Prefab instances are ordinary ECS subtrees. Instance options can override the
root transform, and `overrides` can patch component fields by prefab-local id
without mutating the registered blueprint.

## Custom WGSL Materials

Generated browser apps can author a data-only custom WGSL material from config
assets and worker systems. Systems never create WebGPU objects; they declare
shader source, render state, binding layouts, and JSON-safe uniform values. The
main-thread WebGPU app mirrors the source assets, compiles WGSL, creates
renderer-owned buffers/bind groups/pipelines, and submits the final frame.

Declare path-loaded shader source in `aperture.config.ts`:

```ts
import { asset, defineApertureConfig } from "@aperture-engine/app/config";

export default defineApertureConfig({
  mode: "browser",
  canvas: "#aperture",
  systems: ["src/systems/**/*.system.ts"],
  assets: {
    water: asset.shader("/shaders/water.wgsl", { preload: "blocking" }),
  },
});
```

Use the shader handle from a worker system:

```ts
import {
  EcsType,
  createSystem,
  material,
  mesh,
  shader,
} from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

export default class WaterSetupSystem extends createSystem({ priority: 0 }) {
  override init(): void {
    this.spawn.mesh({
      key: "water",
      mesh: mesh.plane({ size: [6, 3] }),
      material: material.customWgsl({
        familyKey: "app/water",
        label: "Water",
        shader: shader.asset(this.assets.shader("water")),
        entryPoints: { vertex: "vs_main", fragment: "fs_main" },
        renderState: {
          cullMode: "none",
          depth: { test: true, write: false, compare: "less" },
          blend: { preset: "alpha" },
          alphaMode: "blend",
        },
        bindings: [
          material.uniform("water", {
            binding: 0,
            visibility: ["fragment"],
            fields: {
              color: { type: EcsType.Vec4, default: [0.02, 0.46, 0.9, 1] },
              time: { type: EcsType.Float32, default: 0 },
            },
            values: {
              color: [0.02, 0.46, 0.9, 1],
              time: 0,
            },
          }),
        ],
      }),
    });
  }
}
```

Inline WGSL is available for tests and small demos:

```ts
material.customWgsl({
  familyKey: "example/tint",
  label: "Inline Tint",
  shader: shader.inlineWgsl(WGSL, { virtualPath: "inline-tint.wgsl" }),
  entryPoints: { vertex: "vs_main", fragment: "fs_main" },
});
```

V1 custom WGSL shaders use fixed renderer groups:

- `@group(0) @binding(0)`: view uniform, renderer-owned. The layout is
  `{ viewProjection: mat4x4f, cameraPosition: vec4f }`.
- `@group(1) @binding(0)`: read-only storage array of world transforms,
  renderer-owned. Index with `@builtin(instance_index)`.
- `@group(2)`: custom material bindings declared by `material.customWgsl(...)`.
- `@group(3)`: reserved for future renderer extensions.

Mesh vertex locations follow the built-in instance layout: `@location(0)`
position (`vec3f`), `@location(1)` normal (`vec3f`), and `@location(2)` UV
(`vec2f`). Use `runtimeUniformKey` on a group-2 uniform binding when per-frame
values should come from `this.spawn.runtimeUniform(...)`.

Current limitations: WGSL only; no shader imports; no user-supplied WebGPU
objects or callbacks; no arbitrary app-owned material adapter registration; and
lighting/environment integration is deferred. App-route custom WGSL supports
group-2 uniform buffers, texture bindings, sampler bindings, existing
instance-attribute layouts, and mixed built-in/custom frames through the normal
`createWebGpuApp()` path. Storage-buffer bindings are validated but reported as
unsupported until a renderer-independent buffer source asset exists.

See [`recipes/custom-wgsl-material.md`](./recipes/custom-wgsl-material.md) for
a complete shader and material setup.

## Runtime Systems

Systems map to EliCS systems and can query ECS components directly.

```ts
import {
  EcsType,
  LocalTransform,
  Name,
  createSystem,
  quatFromAxisAngle,
} from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

export default class SpinCrateSystem extends createSystem({
  priority: 100,
  queries: {
    crates: {
      required: [Name, LocalTransform],
      where: [{ component: Name, key: "value", op: "eq", value: "crate" }],
    },
  },
  config: {
    speed: { type: EcsType.Float32, default: 1 },
  },
}) {
  override update(_delta: number, time: number): void {
    const speed = this.config.speed.value;

    for (const entity of this.queries.crates.entities) {
      entity
        .getVectorView(LocalTransform, "rotation")
        .set(quatFromAxisAngle([0, 1, 0], time * speed));
    }
  }
}
```

Lower numeric `priority` runs earlier. Omit it to default to `0`. `priority` is
static registration metadata from the `createSystem({ ... })` descriptor; it is
not a runtime signal and does not appear in `this.config`. Fields declared under
`config` become runtime signals such as `this.config.speed.value`. System
modules default-export the class; the generated worker registers discovered
systems in priority order. The main-thread generated bootstrap receives
serializable manifest metadata, not live system classes.

`this.queries.<name>.entities` is a `Set<Entity>`. Iterate it with `for...of`,
test membership with `.has(entity)`, and use `.size` for counts.

Use negative priorities only for very early setup, keep ordinary gameplay near
`0` to `100`, and reserve larger values for late reactions such as camera follow
or UI/status synchronization.

## System Context Facades

Inside a system, `this` exposes the whole authoring surface. Everything is typed
and discoverable by autocomplete — you rarely need to import the lower-level
runtime packages directly.

| Accessor                                       | What it gives you                                                                                                                                                          |

## Physics

Enable the Rapier rigid-body backend in `aperture.config.ts`. Setting `physics`
also turns on the fixed-step clock that drives it:

```ts
export default defineApertureConfig({
  // ...
  physics: { backend: "rapier", gravity: [0, -9.81, 0] },
  // or simply: physics: true
});
```

Author bodies inline on a spawned mesh, or spawn a non-rendered body with
`this.spawn.physics(...)`. You do **not** need to import
`@aperture-engine/physics`: the `physics` helper namespace from
`@aperture-engine/app/systems` builds the descriptors, and every `type`/`kind`
is a plain string union.

```ts
import {
  createSystem,
  mesh,
  material,
  physics,
} from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

// A rendered dynamic body:
this.spawn.mesh({
  key: "crate",
  mesh: mesh.box({ size: [1, 1, 1] }),
  material: material.standard(),
  transform: { translation: [0, 4, 0] },
  physics: {
    rigidBody: { type: "dynamic" }, // "static" | "dynamic" | "kinematicPosition" | "kinematicVelocity"
    collider: { shape: { kind: "box", halfExtents: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] } },
  },
});

// A static floor with the equivalent helper form:
this.spawn.physics({
  key: "floor",
  physics: physics.body({
    rigidBody: { type: "static" },
    collider: { shape: { kind: "box", halfExtents: [10, 0.5, 10] } },
  }),
});
```

### Who owns the transform

Physics is authoritative for the pose of any body it simulates, and writes that
pose back into `LocalTransform` every fixed step. This has one important
consequence:

> **Do not move a physics body by writing `LocalTransform` directly — the
> writeback overwrites it the same frame, with no error.**

- **Dynamic** bodies are driven by forces/impulses/velocity and gravity. Read
  their pose from `LocalTransform`; nudge them with `this.physics.applyImpulse`,
  `setLinearVelocity`, etc.
- **Kinematic** bodies are driven by _you_. Move them with
  `this.physics.setKinematicTarget(entity, { translation })` (rotation is
  optional — omit it to keep the current orientation). Spawn them with
  `rigidBody: { type: "kinematicPosition" }` and a `kinematicTarget`.

### Character controller

Drive a kinematic character with `this.physics.moveCharacter`, then commit the
collision-resolved result back to the body:

```ts
const result = this.physics.moveCharacter({
  entity: serializeEntityRef(body),
  desiredTranslation: [dx, dy, dz], // this frame's intended displacement
  settings: { snapToGroundDistance: 0.5, maxSlopeClimbAngle: Math.PI / 4 },
});
if (result !== null) {
  this.physics.setKinematicTarget(body, {
    translation: result.targetTranslation,
  });
  // result.grounded / result.collisions are available for jump + contact logic
}
```

`snapToGroundDistance` must exceed the rest gap between the collider and the
floor or `grounded` never latches; a small constant downward "stick" velocity
while grounded keeps the controller engaged.

## Input, Signals, And Effects

Use lifecycle-owned effects for ECS mutation driven by signals. Do not use raw
Preact `effect()` for arbitrary microtask-time ECS writes.

```ts
import { createSystem } from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

export default class SelectSystem extends createSystem({
  priority: 50,
}) {
  override init(): void {
    const select = this.actions.select;
    if (select.kind !== "button") {
      return;
    }

    this.effects.watch(
      select.pressed,
      (pressed) => {
        if (!pressed) {
          return;
        }

        this.signals.gameplayMode.value = "select";
        this.diagnostics.info("select.pressed", {
          pointer: this.input.pointer.primary.position.value,
        });
      },
      { phase: "input" },
    );
  }
}
```

Effects registered in `init()` are disposed on system destroy and flushed in
explicit simulation phases: `input` before system updates, `update` after system
updates, and `postUpdate` after interaction processing. Input actions are
forwarded from the generated browser bootstrap into worker-owned signals before
system effects run.
Use `this.actions.jump.down()` for one-frame button presses, `this.actions.move.x`
and `this.actions.move.y` for axis2d actions, `this.keyboard.down("KeyP")` for
direct keyboard edges, and `this.gamepads.primary?.down("south")` for direct
standard gamepad reads. The Vite plugin writes `.aperture/generated/aperture-env.d.ts`
so configured `input.button`, `input.axis1d`, and `input.axis2d` actions receive
kind-specific system types.

## Spatial Queries

Spatial queries are synchronous helpers over ECS-owned data in the
logic/simulation context. Bounds raycasts use `this.spatial.setBounds(...)`;
exact visual mesh raycasts use `this.spatial.setMeshes(...)` with
renderer-independent CPU mesh data and an optional mesh BVH. Both paths return
canonical entity references, and gameplay systems do not await raycasts.

```ts
const ray = this.cameras.main.rayFromPointer(
  this.input.pointer.primary.position.value,
);

const hit = this.spatial.raycastFirst(ray, {
  source: "visual-mesh",
  fallback: "bounds",
  maxDistance: 20,
});

this.signals.selectedEntity.value = hit?.entity.ref ?? null;
```

Use spatial queries from systems; do not move picking state into the renderer as
the source of truth.

## Commands And Manual Assets

Commands are the worker-owned path for browser UI, tools, or MCP-style bridges
to request simulation work. Browser code dispatches a serializable command
event; the generated bootstrap forwards it to the worker.

```ts
window.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent("aperture:command", {
    detail: {
      channel: "asset.request",
      payload: { assetId: "decal" },
    },
  }),
);
```

A system drains the channel and requests the manual asset:

```ts
import { createSystem } from "@aperture-engine/app/systems";

export default class AssetCommandSystem extends createSystem({
  priority: 75,
}) {
  override update(): void {
    for (const command of this.commands.drain<{ assetId?: unknown }>(
      "asset.request",
    )) {
      if (typeof command.assetId !== "string") {
        this.diagnostics.warn("command.assetRequest.invalid", {
          suggestedFix:
            "Send { assetId: 'decal' } on the asset.request command channel.",
        });
        continue;
      }

      void this.commands.requestAsset(command.assetId).then(() => {
        this.diagnostics.info("command.assetRequest.ready", {
          asset: command.assetId,
          ready: this.assets.readiness(command.assetId).value,
        });
      });
    }
  }
}
```

Runtime asset requests should be expressed through systems and commands. User
code should not touch loader reports, transfer packages, snapshot transport, or
renderer-side registration.

## Diagnostics And Entity Lookup

Generated browser, worker, and headless statuses are JSON-safe. Systems can
publish diagnostics with stable codes:

```ts
if (this.assets.gltf("robot").error.value) {
  this.diagnostics.error("asset.robot.failed", {
    asset: "robot",
    suggestedFix: "Check the URL in aperture.config.ts.",
  });
}
```

Entity summaries use ECS identity plus optional app metadata:

```ts
{
  entity: { index: 12, generation: 0 },
  key: "level.robot",
  name: "robot",
  tags: ["asset", "robot"],
  componentIds: ["Name", "LocalTransform", "Mesh"],
  source: { assetId: "robot", gltfNodeIndex: 0 }
}
```

Tools should use `{ index, generation }` for follow-up operations and rerun
entity lookup when a generation-mismatch diagnostic says the reference is
stale.

The generated browser bridge exposes the same inspection path through
JSON-safe command channels for developer panels and MCP-style tools:

- `aperture.devtools.entity.find`
- `aperture.devtools.entity.get`
- `aperture.devtools.entity.setComponent`
- `aperture.devtools.entity.snapshot`
- `aperture.devtools.entity.diff`

Those commands are handled inside the generated simulation worker before normal
system command queues. They read or mutate only worker-owned ECS state, and the
browser observes the result through generated status such as `entityTools` and
`lastFailure`.

## Headless Mode

Headless mode uses the same system authoring shape:

```ts
import { defineApertureConfig } from "@aperture-engine/app/config";

export default defineApertureConfig({
  mode: "headless",
  systems: ["src/systems/**/*.system.ts"],
});
```

Headless tests can step the app through advanced helpers without importing DOM,
canvas, `navigator.gpu`, or WebGPU presentation code.

Browser config asset URLs such as `/assets/robot.glb` are served by Vite or the
generated app host. In Node/headless tests, provide an `assetLoader` when those
URLs need to resolve, or mark the asset `preload: "manual"` and inject ready
source assets through `app.context.assetsRegistry`.

```ts
import { asset, defineApertureConfig } from "@aperture-engine/app/config";

const app = await createApertureApp({
  config: defineApertureConfig({
    mode: "headless",
    assets: {
      robot: asset.gltf("/assets/robot.glb", { preload: "blocking" }),
    },
  }),
  assetLoader: {
    async load(assetHandle) {
      if (assetHandle.id !== "robot") {
        return;
      }

      // Load or register the test fixture, then mark the handle ready.
    },
  },
});
```

## Advanced APIs

Programmatic app creation, manual stepping, manual worker transport, direct
render snapshot inspection, source asset transfer packages, renderer-side
registration, custom render hosts, and custom WebGPU orchestration remain
available as advanced paths.

Use these only when you are building generated bootstrap internals, tests,
tools, render-only consumers, or nonstandard loops:

```ts
import { createApertureApp } from "@aperture-engine/app/advanced";
import { createExtractionApp } from "@aperture-engine/runtime";
import { createWebGpuApp } from "@aperture-engine/webgpu";
```

Start with [`ADVANCED_ORCHESTRATION.md`](./ADVANCED_ORCHESTRATION.md) when you
need the worker/main split, manual snapshot posting, source asset transfer
packages, or direct WebGPU presentation control.
