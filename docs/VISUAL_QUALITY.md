How Aperture apps get their look, what a fresh app ships with, and which knobs
to reach for when a scene reads flat. This is the doc to read **before**
hand-rolling lighting, skies, or post effects — most of the polished baseline
is already on by default, and the rest is one config field away.

## The default look

A generated app (anything scaffolded by `aperture create`, or any app started
through `@aperture-engine/app`) gets this without configuration:

| Feature      | Default                                        | Where                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Tone mapping | `"aces"` (filmic) through the HDR scene buffer | `render.tonemap`                 |
| Exposure     | `1` (enables the rgba16float HDR path)         | `render.exposure`                |
| MSAA         | 4x                                             | `render.sampleCount`             |
| Pixel ratio  | device DPR capped at 2                         | `render.maxPixelRatio`           |
| Environment  | daylight gradient sky + image-based lighting   | `render.defaultEnvironment`      |
| Bloom / SSAO | off (one config field each)                    | `render.bloom` / `render.ssao`   |
| Shadows      | off (opt-in per light)                         | `spawn.light({ shadow: {...} })` |

The templates additionally author a shadow-casting directional sun, a ground
plane that receives shadows, and a subtle bloom. Copy that recipe — it is the
same one the `showcase/` games use.

```ts
render: {
  tonemap: "aces",           // filmic roll-off; the showcase default
  exposure: 1,               // HDR scene buffer; required by bloom/SSAO
  bloom: { threshold: 0.75, intensity: 0.04, radiusPixels: 2 },
  sampleCount: 4,
  maxPixelRatio: 2,
},
```

## The default environment

Unlit scenes are the single biggest source of "why does my app look bad":
`StandardMaterial` is physically based, so with no lights and no environment
it renders black on a black clear color. To make the zero-config path look
intentional, every app gets a **default daylight environment** — a procedural
gradient sky (soft blue → pale horizon → warm ground) plus matching
image-based lighting fed through the PMREM/irradiance chain, so PBR materials
are lit and have plausible reflections immediately.

The default suppresses itself when the app authors any of:

- a `ProceduralSky` (`this.spawn.proceduralSky({...})`),
- a `Skybox` (`this.spawn.skybox({...})`),
- an environment light (`this.spawn.light({ kind: "environment", ... })`),

or when the config opts out:

```ts
render: {
  defaultEnvironment: false,
},
```

Plain directional/ambient/point lights do **not** suppress it — a sun plus
the default sky is the intended combination. The environment contributes the
ambient/fill term, so scenes generally do not need an `ambient` fill light on
top of it.

To replace the look, author your own sky and keep IBL:
`spawn.proceduralSky` for a gradient (see `createProceduralSky` for the
tunables — colors, horizon position/softness, sun disk), `spawn.skybox` for a
cubemap background (see `showcase/fps` for a panorama-sourced example), and an
environment light for custom IBL. Custom HDR IBL in browser apps currently
requires registering equirect pixel data imperatively (see
`examples/ibl-equirect*` for the payload shape) — the config `asset.hdr(url)`
descriptor does not yet decode pixels in the browser worker.

## Tone mapping and exposure

Operators: `"aces"` (default, filmic), `"agx"`, `"neutral"`, `"reinhard"`,
`"linear"`, `"none"` — the named ones are faithful ports of the three.js
operators. Generated apps render into an rgba16float scene buffer and apply
tonemap + exposure + sRGB encode as the final post stage.

Opt out with `tonemap: "none"`: when neither `exposure` nor a post effect is
configured, that keeps the legacy byte-identical 8-bit path — this is the
setting golden-image baselines and byte-exact render tests should pin.

## Bloom and SSAO

Both are one config field and imply the HDR path:

```ts
render: {
  bloom: { threshold: 0.75, intensity: 0.04, radiusPixels: 2 },
  ssao: true, // or { radiusPixels, intensity, power, sampleCount }
},
```

Keep bloom subtle (the showcases use intensity 0.02–0.06); it should read as
glow on emissive/bright pixels, not haze. SSAO attenuates indirect light in
creases and contact regions — it grounds objects that otherwise look pasted
onto the scene. Further post effects (SSR, DoF, TAA, FXAA) exist at the
renderer level (`docs/POST_EFFECTS.md`) and are wired through
`createWebGpuApp({ postEffects })` or user passes.

## Shadows

Off by default; enable them on the light that acts as your sun, and mark
meshes:

```ts
this.spawn.light({
  key: "light.sun",
  kind: "directional",
  illuminance: 4,
  transform: { rotationEulerDegrees: [-45, 35, 0] },
  shadow: {
    mapSize: 2048,
    cascadeCount: 1,
    shadowType: 1,
    strength: 0.75,
    filterRadius: 2,
    normalBias: 0.04,
  },
});

this.spawn.mesh({ ..., castShadow: true, receiveShadow: true });
```

A scene with no shadow receiver under the objects (e.g. no ground plane)
will look like it floats regardless of light quality.

## Materials

`material.standard()` is metallic-roughness PBR:

- **`metallic` defaults to `0` (dielectric).** A metal has no diffuse
  response — it renders near-black without an environment map — so
  hand-authored materials are dielectric unless you say otherwise. Only set
  `metallic: 1` when the scene has IBL (the default environment counts).
- **glTF imports keep the glTF spec default** (`metallicFactor: 1`) — that is
  the asset author's contract, not a scene-authoring choice.
- `roughness` defaults to `1` (fully diffuse). Most surfaces read best
  between 0.4 and 0.9; mirrors and polished metal go low.
- `emissiveFactor` may exceed 1 — with bloom enabled that is how you make
  something glow.

## When a scene looks flat — checklist

1. **Everything near-black?** The default environment was suppressed (an
   authored `ProceduralSky`/`Skybox`/environment light exists, or
   `defaultEnvironment: false`) and no other lights were added — or a
   material sets `metallic: 1` with no IBL.
2. **Washed out / clipped highlights?** `tonemap` was set to `"none"` —
   remove the override or set `"aces"`.
3. **Objects float?** No shadow: enable `shadow` on the sun and set
   `castShadow`/`receiveShadow` on meshes, and give the scene a ground
   receiver.
4. **Everything grey and uniform?** Only ambient light — add a directional
   sun for direction and contrast; the environment supplies the fill.
5. **Glow missing?** Bloom is off — set `render.bloom` (and use emissive
   materials above 1).

## Reference configs

The showcase games are the proof points — copy their render blocks and setup
systems rather than inventing new baselines:

- `showcase/fps/aperture.config.ts` — ACES + bloom + skybox + shadow-casting
  sun + fog.
- `showcase/platformer/src/systems/setup.system.ts` — sun shadow settings +
  blob shadows.
- `showcase/city-builder/aperture.shared-config.ts` — device profiles with
  per-tier bloom.
- `packages/cli/src/create/templates/*.ts` — the scaffolded baseline
  (sun + shadows + ground + bloom over the default environment).
