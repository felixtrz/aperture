# Backlog

This file contains immediate executable tasks.

Agents should work on one task at a time, but should continue into the next ready task when the current task finishes before the 45-minute run window has elapsed.

Do not stop merely because one task is complete. Stop only when the 45-minute work window has elapsed, no ready task remains, or a stop condition applies.

When tasks are completed, move them to `agent/COMPLETED.md` or mark them complete here and summarize in handoff.

## Execution Note

The MVP 3D concept coverage gate is complete. Ready tasks are now implementation slices derived from:

- `docs/MVP_3D_CONCEPTS.md`
- `docs/research/TRANSFORM_AND_SPATIAL_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/MESH_GEOMETRY_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/MATERIAL_TEXTURE_RENDER_STATE_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/CAMERA_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/LIGHTING_ENVIRONMENT_SHADOW_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/ASSET_LOADER_SCENE_IMPORT_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/ANIMATION_SKINNING_MORPH_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/INTERACTION_PICKING_PHYSICS_BOUNDARY_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/RENDER_EXTRACTION_WEBGPU_BOUNDARY_COVERAGE.md`

Keep implementation vertical, typed, and testable. Do not introduce a public mutable scene graph, renderer-owned ECS/game state, or WebGL fallback.

## Recommended Next Task

Start with `task-0340`. Browser failure statuses now carry diagnostic counts across extraction, scenario, and resource-binding failures; the next useful slice is reducing repeated JSON-safe status assertions in texture failure tests.

## Ready Tasks

### task-0340 — Add no-raw-GPU assertion helper for texture failures

Reduce repeated JSON-safe status checks across texture/sampler failure specs.

Acceptance criteria:

- A shared test helper asserts status JSON does not expose raw GPU handles or WebGPU creation calls.
- Texture/sampler asset and resource failure specs use the helper where practical.
- Targeted Playwright coverage continues to pass.

### task-0341 — Split multi-entity scenario dispatch into a lookup table

Replace the deeply nested scenario ternary in `examples/multi-entity.js` with a small explicit dispatch table.

Acceptance criteria:

- Scenario behavior and `knownScenarios` remain unchanged.
- The dispatch table does not move ECS state into renderer-owned structures.
- `npm run check:examples` and full Playwright coverage continue to pass.

### task-0342 — Document browser diagnostic count phases

Clarify how `diagnosticCounts` should be interpreted across successful, extraction-failure, and future resource-binding-failure statuses.

Acceptance criteria:

- `docs/BROWSER_E2E_RENDERING.md` describes the count buckets and phase limitations.
- The note preserves ECS/render extraction ownership boundaries.
- No implementation behavior changes.

### task-0343 — Add route guard coverage for resource-binding scenarios

Prevent missing renderer resource scenarios from falling through to the default browser scene.

Acceptance criteria:

- A lightweight Playwright test loads missing mesh/material resource scenarios and asserts `phase: "resource-bindings"`.
- The test remains focused on route/status shape, not full duplicate diagnostics.
- Existing Playwright coverage continues to pass.

### task-0344 — Add diagnostic count assertions for asset-state failures

Lock diagnostic count summaries for loading and failed mesh/material asset statuses.

Acceptance criteria:

- Mesh and material asset status Playwright tests assert `diagnosticCounts`.
- Assertions cover loading and failed asset states without duplicating registry diagnostic bodies.
- Targeted Playwright coverage continues to pass.

## Post-Unlit E2E Verification Targets

Do not start these until the unlit browser path above is working end-to-end and Playwright can verify real rendered pixels reliably. Once that foundation is stable, expand browser E2E coverage across the broader runtime surface:

- Geometry coverage: verify all built-in primitive meshes and mesh upload paths render correctly in browser.
- Material coverage: verify unlit variants first, then add matcap/standard/PBR material paths as they exist.
- Texture coverage: verify texture upload, sampling, UV correctness, and missing-texture diagnostics.
- Lighting coverage: verify directional, point, spot, ambient/environment lighting when those paths are implemented.
- Camera/render-target coverage: verify multiple cameras, viewport/scissor behavior, and offscreen/render-target flows.
- Visibility/sorting coverage: verify layers, hidden/disabled renderables, opaque ordering, and transparency ordering.
- Diagnostics coverage: verify Playwright failure output exposes enough frame status to explain blank canvases, missing resources, or unsupported WebGPU.

Each expansion should keep the same rule: ECS is authoritative, rendering is derived from snapshots/render-world state, and browser verification proves pixels plus JSON-safe frame diagnostics.

## Superseded / Rewritten Tasks

The following pre-gate tasks are superseded by the EliCS adoption and MVP synthesis, or rewritten into the ready tasks above:

- `task-0004 — Implement component registry and storage`: superseded by EliCS adoption; remaining Aperture-specific component work is in `task-0028` and `task-0033`.
- `task-0005 — Implement ECS query API`: superseded by EliCS adoption; query usage should be tested in component and extraction tasks.
- `task-0006 — Implement system schedule`: rewritten into targeted system tasks beginning with `task-0029` and `task-0035`.
- `task-0007 — Add command and event model`: deferred until after the transform/render extraction foundation or rewritten as an input/command task when interaction work begins.
- `task-0008 — Add transform component types`: rewritten as `task-0028`.
- `task-0009 — Implement transform resolution system`: rewritten as `task-0029`.
- `task-0010 — Add render authoring components`: rewritten as `task-0033`.
- `task-0011 — Define asset handle types`: rewritten as `task-0030`.
- `task-0012 — Define RenderPacket and RenderSnapshot`: rewritten as `task-0034`.
- `task-0013 — Implement RenderExtractSystem`: rewritten as `task-0035`.
- `task-0014 — Add architecture invariant tests or checks`: distributed into `task-0030`, `task-0034`, `task-0035`, and `task-0036`.
- `task-0015 — Add WebGPU support detection`: rewritten as `task-0036`.

## Backlog Maintenance Rules

At the end of a run:

- Mark completed task(s).
- Add new tasks if the backlog has fewer than five ready tasks.
- New tasks must align with roadmap and the MVP feature contract.
- New tasks must have acceptance criteria.
- Prefer vertical slices that preserve the ECS/render-extraction boundary.
