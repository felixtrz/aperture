# Backlog

This file contains immediate executable tasks.

Agents should work on one task at a time, but should continue into the next ready task when the current task finishes before the 45-minute run window has elapsed.

Do not stop merely because one task is complete. Stop only when the 45-minute work window has elapsed, no ready task remains, or a stop condition applies.

When tasks are completed, move them to `agent/COMPLETED.md` or mark them complete here and summarize in handoff.

## Execution Note

The MVP 3D concept coverage gate is complete. Ready tasks are now implementation slices derived from:

- `docs/MVP_3D_CONCEPTS.md`
- `docs/research/TRANSFORM_AND_SPATIAL_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/MESH_GEOMETRY_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/MATERIAL_TEXTURE_RENDER_STATE_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/CAMERA_VIEW_RENDER_TARGET_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/LIGHTING_ENVIRONMENT_SHADOW_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/ASSET_LOADER_SCENE_IMPORT_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/ANIMATION_SKINNING_MORPH_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/INTERACTION_PICKING_PHYSICS_BOUNDARY_COVERAGE.md`
- `docs/research/RENDER_EXTRACTION_WEBGPU_BOUNDARY_COVERAGE.md`

Keep implementation vertical, typed, and testable. Do not introduce a public mutable scene graph, renderer-owned ECS/game state, or WebGL fallback.

## Recommended Next Task

Start with `task-0420`. Browser specs now use shared example loaders and static
guards protect helper usage. The next useful slice is reducing repeated shallow
failure-route assertions by applying `expectMultiEntityRouteFailureStatus` to
the remaining route guard families.

## Ready Tasks

### task-0420 — Use failure helper in resource route specs

Migrate resource-binding and texture-upload route guards to
`expectMultiEntityRouteFailureStatus`.

Acceptance criteria:

- `resource-binding-routing.spec.ts` and `texture-upload-routing.spec.ts` use
  the shared failure-route assertion helper where practical.
- Diagnostic-code assertions remain focused and unchanged.
- Targeted typecheck and route Playwright coverage pass.

### task-0421 — Use failure helper in texture resource routes

Migrate texture/sampler GPU resource route guards to
`expectMultiEntityRouteFailureStatus`.

Acceptance criteria:

- `texture-resource-routing.spec.ts` uses the shared failure-route assertion
  helper where practical.
- Diagnostic code-count assertions remain unchanged.
- Targeted typecheck and route Playwright coverage pass.

### task-0422 — Use failure helper in scenario route guard

Migrate the unknown-scenario route guard to the shared failure-route assertion
helper.

Acceptance criteria:

- `scenario-routing.spec.ts` uses `expectMultiEntityRouteFailureStatus`.
- The test still avoids duplicating available-scenario list assertions.
- Targeted typecheck and Playwright coverage pass.

### task-0423 — Document failure helper route coverage

Update browser e2e docs after route guard families consistently use the shared
failure-route helper.

Acceptance criteria:

- Docs mention `expectMultiEntityRouteFailureStatus` as the standard helper for
  shallow failure route guards.
- Docs distinguish count/code checks from detailed diagnostic body assertions.
- Formatting validation passes.

### task-0424 — Audit route helper docs and static guards

Run a focused audit of route helper docs and static guard behavior after the
failure-helper migration.

Acceptance criteria:

- Targeted static scenario guard tests pass.
- Route helper docs remain accurate.
- Handoff records any remaining intentional exceptions.

## Post-Unlit E2E Verification Targets

Do not start these until the unlit browser path above is working end-to-end and Playwright can verify real rendered pixels reliably. Once that foundation is stable, expand browser E2E coverage across the broader runtime surface:

- Geometry coverage: verify all built-in primitive meshes and mesh upload paths render correctly in browser.
- Material coverage: verify unlit variants first, then add matcap/standard/PBR material paths as they exist.
- Texture coverage: verify texture upload, sampling, UV correctness, and missing-texture diagnostics.
- Lighting coverage: verify directional, point, spot, ambient/environment lighting when those paths are implemented.
- Camera/render-target coverage: verify multiple cameras, viewport/scissor behavior, and offscreen/render-target flows.
- Visibility/sorting coverage: verify layers, hidden/disabled renderables, opaque ordering, and transparency ordering.
- Diagnostics coverage: verify Playwright failure output exposes enough frame status to explain blank canvases, missing resources, or unsupported WebGPU.

Each expansion should keep the same rule: ECS is authoritative, rendering is derived from snapshots/render-world state, and browser verification proves pixels plus JSON-safe frame diagnostics.

## Superseded / Rewritten Tasks

The following pre-gate tasks are superseded by the EliCS adoption and MVP synthesis, or rewritten into the ready tasks above:

- `task-0004 — Implement component registry and storage`: superseded by EliCS adoption; remaining Aperture-specific component work is in `task-0028` and `task-0033`.
- `task-0005 — Implement ECS query API`: superseded by EliCS adoption; query usage should be tested in component and extraction tasks.
- `task-0006 — Implement system schedule`: rewritten into targeted system tasks beginning with `task-0029` and `task-0035`.
- `task-0007 — Add command and event model`: deferred until after the transform/render extraction foundation or rewritten as an input/command task when interaction work begins.
- `task-0008 — Add transform component types`: rewritten as `task-0028`.
- `task-0009 — Implement transform resolution system`: rewritten as `task-0029`.
- `task-0010 — Add render authoring components`: rewritten as `task-0033`.
- `task-0011 — Define asset handle types`: rewritten as `task-0030`.
- `task-0012 — Define RenderPacket and RenderSnapshot`: rewritten as `task-0034`.
- `task-0013 — Implement RenderExtractSystem`: rewritten as `task-0035`.
- `task-0014 — Add architecture invariant tests or checks`: distributed into `task-0030`, `task-0034`, `task-0035`, and `task-0036`.
- `task-0015 — Add WebGPU support detection`: rewritten as `task-0036`.

## Backlog Maintenance Rules

At the end of a run:

- Mark completed task(s).
- Add new tasks if the backlog has fewer than five ready tasks.
- New tasks must align with roadmap and the MVP feature contract.
- New tasks must have acceptance criteria.
- Prefer vertical slices that preserve the ECS/render-extraction boundary.
