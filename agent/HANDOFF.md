## Current Status

The render pipeline reference audit is complete.

Recent architecture state:

- The pnpm monorepo/package-boundary refactor is implemented.
- Active packages are `@aperture-engine/simulation`,
  `@aperture-engine/render`, `@aperture-engine/webgpu`,
  `@aperture-engine/runtime`, and `@aperture-engine/core`.
- The active render authoring model uses separate `Mesh` and `Material`
  components rather than `MeshRenderer`.

Latest workflow update:

- `agent/WAKE.md` now requires categorizing selected tasks before
  implementation.
- Ready backlog tasks now include category, package/write-scope, and reference
  anchor metadata.
- Reference policy is explicit:
  - ECS binding, render bridge, assets, and orchestration should anchor on
    `/Users/felixz/Projects/aperture/references/bevy`.
  - WebGPU/render-pipeline work should compare
    `/Users/felixz/Projects/aperture/references/engine` and
    `/Users/felixz/Projects/aperture/references/three.js`, then adapt the common
    patterns to Aperture.
- The backlog now includes recurring `audit-refactor` tasks to catch
  architecture drift every few implementation tasks or after boundary changes.

Completed in this run:

- Added `docs/research/RENDER_PIPELINE_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`.
- Confirmed `/Users/felixz/Projects/aperture/references/engine` is the
  PlayCanvas engine checkout and used it as the canonical PlayCanvas reference.
- Compared Aperture's current render pipeline against local Three.js and
  PlayCanvas renderer implementations.
- Documented the current Aperture pipeline:
  `RenderSnapshot -> RenderWorld.applySnapshot -> resource binding updates ->
draw readiness report -> RenderWorldDrawPackage plan -> DrawCommandDescriptor
plan -> RenderPassDrawList plan -> render pass resource resolution ->
RenderPassCommand plan -> command execution/frame report`.
- Added prioritized follow-up tasks `task-0546` through `task-0550` for render
  phases, pipeline cache keys, bind group layout metadata, view/pass queues, and
  resource lifetime/version inspection.

- PlayCanvas `src/platform/graphics/webgpu/webgpu-graphics-device.js`

## Architecture Notes

- ECS remains authoritative.
- Rendering remains derived from extracted snapshots/render-world data.
- `@aperture-engine/simulation` imports no render/runtime/WebGPU packages.
- `@aperture-engine/render` imports simulation only.
- `@aperture-engine/runtime` imports simulation and render only.
- `@aperture-engine/core` does not import or export WebGPU.
- `@aperture-engine/webgpu` does not import runtime or core.
- WebGPU examples import `@aperture-engine/core` and
  `@aperture-engine/webgpu` explicitly.
- The renderer pipeline should now evolve in the order captured by
  `docs/research/RENDER_PIPELINE_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`: explicit phase model,
  expanded pipeline keys, bind group layout metadata, view/pass render queues,
  then resource lifetime/version diagnostics.

## Files Touched

Docs/bookkeeping:

- `docs/research/RENDER_PIPELINE_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`
- `agent/BACKLOG.md`
- `agent/COMPLETED.md`
- `agent/HANDOFF.md`
- `agent/STATUS.json`

## Validation Run

- `pnpm exec prettier --write docs/research/RENDER_PIPELINE_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md agent/BACKLOG.md agent/COMPLETED.md agent/HANDOFF.md agent/STATUS.json agent/WAKE.md`
  completed.
- `pnpm run format:check` passed.

## Known Issues

- Typed asset collections are still not implemented; callers still use
  `AssetRegistry` directly.
- Render asset preparation is still spread across render/WebGPU helpers and
  examples rather than a formal renderer-independent adapter contract.
- Runtime does not yet provide a `createWebGpuApp` facade; WebGPU examples still
  contain backend setup code.
- PBR remains blocked on typed assets, material-family contracts, and render
  asset preparation.
- The audit identified render pipeline drift risks that should be handled before
  deeper shader/PBR work: mixed stage vocabulary, narrow pipeline cache keys,
  implicit bind group layout contracts, no view/pass queue model, and no formal
  resource lifetime/version inspection.

## Recommended Next Task

Start with `task-0546 — Add render frame phase model and report`. This should
make the current pipeline stage vocabulary explicit before changing cache keys,
bind groups, render queues, or resource lifetime behavior.
