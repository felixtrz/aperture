# Agent Handoff

Updated: 2026-05-19T14:58:23Z

## Summary

Completed `task-1953` through `task-1975` in this run.

This run advanced the GLB/glTF ingestion spine from report-only source status to
controlled runtime replay and browser render-path readbacks:

- Added compact no-fetch ECS command-plan output summaries.
- Added report-only ECS replay-readiness summaries.
- Added `applyGltfEcsCommandPlanToApp(...)` as the explicit runtime facade for
  applying glTF ECS command plans to an app world.
- Routed the browser GLTF scene's main replay through that runtime facade.
- Added buffer-backed GLB command-plan and replay-readiness status to the
  browser scene.
- Replayed one buffer-backed GLB-derived primitive into ECS in the browser scene
  and asserted four extracted mesh draws, four WebGPU draw calls, and four
  active render-world draws.

The `task-1975` browser proof is currently readback/status-based rather than an
isolated pixel proof. The buffer-backed mesh and proof material are prepared and
included in the WebGPU render route, but the placement/material mapping still
needs a follow-up audit/planning slice before treating it as final visual
fidelity.

## Reference Anchors Inspected

- Project docs: `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
  `docs/MEDIUM_LONG_TERM_GOALS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Existing GLTF browser example and e2e route:
  `examples/gltf-scene.js`, `test/e2e/gltf-scene.spec.ts`.
- Existing GLB/source-loader and ECS replay helpers under
  `packages/render/src/assets`.
- Runtime facade patterns in `packages/runtime/src/index.ts`.
- Local Bevy reference was used conceptually for the runtime-orchestration
  boundary: source/import produces data, runtime/app orchestration applies ECS
  commands, and rendering remains derived from extraction.

## Known Issues

- Buffer-backed GLB visible replay is proven through browser status and
  render-path readbacks, not through an isolated pixel region yet.
- The visible buffer-backed primitive uses an explicitly registered proof
  material. Source-driven GLB material mapping for that primitive remains
  deferred.
- External GLB loading/fetching remains deferred; current source-loader work is
  no-fetch and caller-provided bytes only.
- Source-loader output remains report-only by design; it does not mutate asset
  registries or ECS worlds.
- Typed asset collections are still not implemented; callers still use
  `AssetRegistry` directly.

## Recommended Next Task

Start with `task-1976 — Audit visible buffer-backed GLB primitive replay proof`.

Focus the audit on:

- ECS remains the authority and WebGPU only consumes extracted/render-world data.
- Source loading remains separate from replay execution.
- The readback-based browser proof is honest about the missing isolated pixel.
- The next implementation slice should plan source-driven material mapping for
  the buffer-backed primitive rather than broad GLB viewer behavior.
