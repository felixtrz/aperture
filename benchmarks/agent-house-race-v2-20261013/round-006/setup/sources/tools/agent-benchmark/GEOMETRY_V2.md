# Binary geometry capture v2

The native upload budget retains pre-seal bytes only for VERTEX buffers and
CPU-only INDIRECT argument buffers. Uniform, index, staging and unrelated
storage uploads retain resource metadata but do not consume this proof budget.
Mixed VERTEX/STORAGE buffers remain geometry candidates. All existing byte,
segment and buffer-record caps and conservative indirect mutation rules remain;
real candidate overflow still refuses exact export. Sealed geometry proves
submitted vertex uploads; it does not claim native index-upload byte parity.

This additive protocol retains the scientific contract: 60 warmup frames, 120
measured frames, three fixed cameras, three fresh-browser trials per engine,
identical scene/author budgets, and unchanged scoring weights. Both engines in a
fresh round use the same immutable v2 harness. Original v1 native modules,
recordings and failed trials remain unchanged. Old failures cannot be rerun or
rescored through this protocol.

Geometry export occurs after the last measured frame (179), before the three
camera views. Numeric copying, geometry analysis, hashing, serialization and
upload stay outside the measured window. A capture failure retains all completed
raw warmup/measured samples in failure.json and makes the attempt ineligible.
Raw vertex-upload observation remains enabled from startup through the last
measured frame. Its bounded byte copies run during measurement for both engines;
CPU timings include that common instrumentation and must not be compared directly
with v1 timings that sealed uploads before measurement.

inspectGeometry must return owned coherent arrays, including every visible mesh,
index, normal, actual world matrix and instance matrix. Live SharedArrayBuffer
views are rejected; public SDK readers can produce owned coherent copies.
Typed numeric arrays retain their element dtype, with explicit little-endian
encoding. Ordinary Number arrays and all matrix rows use IEEE754 Float64LE.
Both a supplied world matrix and supplied instance matrices are retained, even
when instance matrices determine effective transforms. No coordinates are
quantized, sampled or omitted. Index range, affine matrices, triangle counts,
degeneracy, bounds and normals are independently checked.

The source numeric stream has contiguous chunks of at most 4 MiB and a total
256 MiB limit. Raw native upload segments have 4 MiB parts and a total 64 MiB
limit. Every POST requires a matching immutable acknowledgment of path, byte
length and SHA256. The final geometry-manifest-v2.json commits all parts, field
offsets, dtype, lengths, matrix row container runs, counts, canonical hashes,
exact positive native-position witnesses and full matrix/multiplicity digest.
The host verifies all receipts, reconstructs numeric readers and native segments,
and recomputes geometry facts and hashes. A positive witness must match every
Float32 position in a submitted native vertex-buffer span. This correlation does
not independently prove native index/shader/transform interpretation or final
visibility; source audits and view judgments remain necessary.

Native capture counts final nonoverlapping retained bytes: replacing a span
subtracts the overwritten bytes before testing the cap. A genuinely over-budget
write discards any stale overlapping captured bytes and permanently marks capture
incomplete. It cannot appear as successful parity against obsolete uploads.

Limits are frozen in protocol-v2.mjs: metadata 8 MiB, 5,000 meshes, 100,000 native buffer records, 10,000 native
segments, 1,000,000 total matrix rows, 20,000 matrix-container runs, 20,000,000
transformed vertices and 10,000,000 instanced triangles. Native parity search has
20,000,000 comparisons per mesh and 1,000,000,000 per export; exhaustion is an
explicit unmatched result that reduces documented parity confidence. It does not
claim an exact positive witness or change the existing manual source-audit
eligibility requirement. Aggregate
HTTP attempts and artifact counts are bounded, with one reserved 8 MiB failure
record. Numeric, native-capture and metadata capacity exhaustion fail the entire attempt,
including omitted observer records and incomplete raw writes. Matcher comparison
work exhaustion records an unmatched witness as described above. No assets are
silently reduced. No retries or larger
unbounded JSON fallback are permitted.

Both engines receive the same 1,800,000 ms verifier readiness/navigation deadline.
It applies to approved verifier waits, not a strict whole-process wall timeout.
The client retains its 120-second interface registration deadline. Controlled
frame promises and native queue fences use the approved verifier readiness wait;
browser shutdown and lifecycle descendant reaping remain awaited. Runtime flags,
security configuration and the rendering verification route are unchanged.

Before author dispatch, preparation freezes all protocol/client/observer/runner/
recorder/summary inputs and provides the same generic transport, capture-phase,
instrumentation and deadline rules to both authors. Protocol v1 and v2 evidence
cannot be mixed within one round. A completed six-attempt sequence with an
ineligible offline summary is recorded as completed-ineligible and retains its
nonzero exit status; unresolved lifecycle/control errors halt for reconciliation.

## Native indirect triangle accounting v2.1

The common observer counts native direct arguments and fully readable CPU-written
indirect arguments at queue submission. Supported arguments are retained as exact
little-endian16B/20B byte witnesses, including first index/vertex, signed indexed
baseVertex and firstInstance. Full buffer/offset/method/topology/bytes/provenance
tuples are deduplicated; each controlled frame retains references and multiplicity.
Repeated static draws do not spend additional distinct-witness capacity.

STORAGE buffers, shared CPU sources, incomplete/opaque spans, unsupported topology
and unproven GPU mutations remain explicit unknown indirect contributions. Known
GPU buffer mutation destinations and opaque routes invalidate CPU span provenance
conservatively until a complete argument-span CPU overwrite. Indexed strips are
unknown because primitive restart is not proven by argument bytes. All real calls
remain counted; unknown contributions are0 in the documented triangle lower bound.
Source/index/shader/world-transform review remains necessary; this is not a GPU
readback or a visibility proof. No native flags, buffer usage, waits or fences change.

Samples retain known/unknown indirect calls, exact known indirect contributions,
unknown reasons and supported/lower-bound confidence. Metadata is bounded by
16,384 distinct witnesses and the existing8MiB transport capacity. Exhaustion
marks proof incomplete while observed known counters stay accurate; export fails
after all120 measured frames so numeric samples survive. Metadata is never
trimmed to make a trial eligible. Only the newly frozen common v2.1 protocol can
claim supported indirect contributions; original v1 and old v2 recordings stay
unchanged and are not rescored through this repair.

Command-buffer mutation destinations are conservatively invalidated before any
draw in the submitted list is counted, including a mutation ordered later than
an indirect draw. Indexed triangle-strip direct calls also remain unknown because
restart indices are not established; unsafe direct arithmetic is never reported
as exact. unknownDirectTriangleDrawCalls makes these lower-bound contributions
explicit. Legitimate render-bundle finish preserves readable provenance, and
replayed indirect bundles read the latest CPU-written arguments at each submit.

CPU-only indirect argument capture remains active through all three controlled
post-export camera views. POSITION upload receipts and capture statistics freeze
after measured frame 179. The observer preserves owned pre-seal argument bytes for
cached command replay and observes subsequent native queue/mapped CPU writes at
submit; GPU mutation, STORAGE, shared writes, incomplete capture and unsupported
topology retain the same conservative unknown policy. This lifetime is explicitly
versioned as `aperture.native-indirect-capture-lifetime.v2.2`. The argument proof
dictionary remains bounded to 16,384 distinct witnesses.

The 64 MiB native byte budget and 10,000 total/1,000 per-buffer segment budgets
cover frozen POSITION receipts plus live owned argument storage together. Raw
bytes that were neither exported nor needed for CPU-only indirect arguments are
released at sealing. Mixed VERTEX|INDIRECT buffers keep immutable exported bytes
and use a separately budgeted owned copy for live arguments; copying does not
establish new CPU provenance. Original pre-seal failures remain in the frozen
geometry statistics. Post-seal capacity exhaustion is explicit and fails the
attempt after retaining the 120 measured samples, rather than accepting unknown
counts as complete proof. No readback, fence, buffer usage, workload or score
weights change. Prior diagnostic artifacts and protocol freezes remain unchanged.
